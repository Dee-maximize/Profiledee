  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Hammed Ademola Oluwapelumi, and I have the privilege of being the firstborn in my family of four. I am deeply passionate about fitness and have an appreciation for good music. I find joy in helping others navigate their challenges and take great satisfaction in bringing happiness to those around me. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Estate Management and Valuation at the University of Ilorin.
    <br><br>
    In addition to my studies, I operate a barbing business known as Dees Cuts. I have had the pleasure of building a diverse clientele who are pleased with my services. Furthermore, I assist my clients in sourcing quality barbing accessories, including clippers, trimmers, and various hair care products.</p>
